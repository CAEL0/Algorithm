"""
In computer science, Prim's (also known as JarnÃ­k's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning
tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every
vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this
tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection
from the tree to another vertex.
