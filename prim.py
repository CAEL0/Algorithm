"""
In computer science, Prim's (also known as Jarn√≠k's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex,
at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.
